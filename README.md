XProc: An XML Pipeline Language
===============================

This branch of this repository is defunct.

In February 2016, the Working Group concluded that its current efforts to
define _XProc 2.0_ as a refinement of the _XProc 1.0_ XML-based syntax
were not worth pursuing.

This work has been abandoned in favor of
the work now described in the (new)
https://github.com/xproc/specification/ repository.
